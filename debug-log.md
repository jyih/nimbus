Couldn't display post from posts
-posts had full array
-post assigned via .map checking on .id and id from useParams
-reason: route was '/' so had no :id to useParams

Setup Backend API and had the frontend working through Thunk, but wasn't storing in save because the reducer was not added to the RootReducer
